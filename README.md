# Chat Application

This is a chat application built using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and socket.io

The main purpose of this application is that it allows a person to chat with another person in real time.

I made this as a major project for my Bachelor's degree in 2024.

You can also make groups and chat with multiple people at the same time.
